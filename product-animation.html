                            <p>Product animation is basically videos or photos (could be GIFs too, but digital media in general) that is computer generated to help market or display certain aspects of a given physical product. It can be used too to communicate certain feature, operational guides or instructions, but it also can be used simply for aesthetic purposes to make a given product standout and look awesome (that may relative to each brand and its tone).</p>

                            <p>Traditionally, product visuals were made through photography, which is expensive and operationally harder to setup. Digital photography is usually used instead with 3D tools that generate photorealistic content on par their real counterparts. Digital photography (or 3D product animation) is much cheaper and faster than classical photography, delivering results in few hours for a fraction of the cost.</p>

                            <p>Traditionally, a company would hire 3D services, that from freelancers or agencies, to create the product animations for them, which get paid by the hour and can result in expensive bills with lengthy bank-and-forth communication.
